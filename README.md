# ZKProver/AegisBlock

This is a testing repository created for AegisBlock (https://github.com/Shombot/AegisBlock), to test the Zero Knowledge Proofs. The Zero Knowledge Proofs are adapted from a version of ZKProver by JoshThree (https://github.com/joshthree/ZKProver). The full details of how ZKProver is used can be found in the full paper, AegisBlock (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11797).
